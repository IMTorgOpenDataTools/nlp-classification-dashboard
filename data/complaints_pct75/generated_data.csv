XXXX tried to tell me that a relative or roommate must have cashed it, and that I was responsible. I have no relatives in the area, and live alone. XXXX told me that someone must have taken the check from my mailbox, and said that he needed me to present myself to him in person to "" get to the bottom of it.

I think that security camera footage showing me in his office would be added to the file to make it appear as though I applied for the loan in person.   I believe that the practice of sending out checks for loans that were never applied for is deceptive and predatory, because many people receive many checks from many sources, and would believe such a check to be a payment from a client or a settlement, and deposit it without realizing they were obtaining a high-interest loan.   I believe that this contact from Southern Finance was an attempt to commit fraud and collect on a loan that does not exist."

The first representative verified me with the account number, balance and last charges. This took XXXX minutes to get to this point. That representative confirmed that the charge was from {$25.00} charge for a service I intended to pay on my credit card. PayPal opened and billed a line of credit for instead of using the credit card I had registered on the account. I had to hold for an unspecified period to be connected with some XXXX in PayPal collections, as apparently the phone number on their written bill is different than the XXXX they use for collections. I had to go to an appointment, so I could not hold.  I called back and had the same issues with verification. I was put through to the collections department, who was willing to accept payment on the account, but no handle my dispute of the fees ( XXXX times the principal ), because they could not verify my identity.  They even took my credit card number. A less sophisticated consumer may have given up and paid the bill to clean up their credit and avoid the hassle.  I asked for supervisor XXXX times. The representative continued to explain why a supervisor could not help me. I then had to resort to shouting down the representative on the hope that either he would hangup or get me to the supervisor.  The supervisor took the payment and credited the account. He waived the fees. It was interesting that he was able to verify me with the date of birth no one else, including XXXX tries on the automated system could verify.  How can can a company open an account with a wrong social security number, phone number, possible date of birth and email address?  How can you charge some XXXX fees on such a loan when that entity lacks sufficient information to identify the person they are loaning money to. How can you be willing to accept payment on an account, but then not properly service the account? The supervisor did not seem concerned with this, which indicates the corporation condones this conduct.  He, however, was concerned that I had to shout down the rep the speak with the supervisor.  That being said I felt treated unfairly and harassed by the whole process. The need to shout and argue my way to a supervisor.  They only use first names. The XXXX representative and the supervisor, both identified themselves with the same first name. The other first names were generic. If this was a litigated matter PayPal could use my inability to properly identify the exact staff members as a weakness in my claim.  To the best of my recollection only the supervisor advised me that this was an attempt to collect by a debt collector and that any information discussed would be used for that purpose."

The way the person on the phone explained it was once I prepaid the loan {$2000.00}, all my payments would go to the principal. I was financially in need so I agreed and sent the email back agreeing.   I tried to pay back the loan but was told I could only pay on my due date of payment. I call on the XXXX and they say I need to pay on the XXXX. I call back on the first and was told I could not use a credit card but I could use it online. I tried to pay online and would be charge a wiring fee and could only pay {$800.00} per wire so it would have taken me XXXX wires at {$20.00} a piece. I feel that the information I was told when I initially obtained the loan was false. I was never told about how difficult they make the prepay process and all the rules. Cash Call has made it impossible for me to pay back my loan so they can continue to charge me 139 % interest. I feel they were negligent and are committing fraud. I also feel that these high interest loans should not be allowed in the US. If I complete my loan, will have paid {$10000.00} for a {$2500.00} loan. I want this company investigated."

I was recently told by their employee 's that it DOES state on my paperwork exactly what I said, he said "" Well, your are telling the truth, I am reading it right now and they did note on your account that they promised they would not try to get the money before the 3rd when your check arrives.  I had a loan the previous month and paid it back a day early, I paid it that time with my MasterCard XXXX XXXX Debit Card.  I got the first loan on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and paid it back the night of XXXX/XXXX/2015 as I said with my XXXX card with no problems. I got the second loan on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and when the first of the month came, even though it clearly states in their records in their own writing "" Do not take the money out before the third of the month '' they did it anyway which took me from a positive balance to a negative balance of - {$220.00} and to top that of on the same day they took another {$35.00}. My loan was for {$200.00} and I was to pay back {$230.00} which as you see above they got, so they had no reason to take another {$35.00} the same day, but it gets much worse.  I have XXXX set up to take their XXXX out of my account automatically every month and that is why I had a little over XXXX dollars in the account before they broke our agreement and took the money before the XXXX. Well on the XXXX ( the next day ) XXXX took their money, or at least they tried to and since CashNetUSA broke our legally binding oral agreement ( actually since by their own admission it was even written in my paperwork by them I guess they broke a written agreement as well ) so when XXXX could not get their money I was slapper with a second overdraft payment, I say second because when CashNetUSA put me in the negative that was the first overdraft fine of another {$35.00}. So at this point them breaking our contractual agreement so far cost me {$70.00} overdraft fee 's.  Now get this, I had XXXX XXXX transfer money from my Debit Card ( S.S.I ) to my XXXX XXXX account to put me back in the positive and then on the date of XXXX/XXXX/2015 they took another unauthorized {$230.00} out that I did not owe them ( remember they got their money on the XXXX XXXX/XXXX/2015 Believe it or not I am not finished yet, just 4 days after that they went in to my account and took another {$35.00} which I obviously did not owe them and again was unauthorized. When all was done and finished they stole XXXX + XXXX + XXXX and cost me another {$300.00} in overdraft fee 's and since I did not have all of my rent it cost me another {$50.00} late fee, not to mention going the entire month begging for food.  In all they cost me well over {$800.00} and of course I had no choice but to close my bank account To add insult to injury to this day they still say I owe them {$230.00} and turned me over to a collection agency and ruined the credit score I had worked so hard on for years.  I have all of my bank statements from wells fargo and plenty of p [ roof, including many witnesses.  By them breaking our oral as well as written agreement and taking the money out early when their own notes in THEIR handwriting clearly states by their own admission "" Do not take the money until the XXXX ''"

1,0.5112711191177368,261,"Item 1 ) First, The reason I am filing a Complaint against this Payday Loan Company is for several reasons. The first is that there are laws in the state of Illinois that preclude and exclude allowing interest rates greater than 35 %. The interest rates on this loan is very high and some are well above 600 % to 1800 % regarding this loan. And, this should not be allowed by law.  Secondly, the rates are staggering and they never check to see if I could afford these loans as there are rules stating that a purchaser should not pay on more than XXXX outstanding payday loans at any one time. And, I have been paying on a total of ( XXXX ) Payday loans for well over 9 months in succession with much difficulty.  Thirdly, I not only continue to pay these loans with exorbitant rates and fees. But, the huge charges were destroying our ability to live after deducting well over 90 % of my take home income for well over 3 months and I have not paid my mortgage since XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX for both the first and second mortgages and I am in jeopardy of foreclosure as of this date, XX/XX/XXXX.  Lastly, several Companies did not tell me of their extremely high rates they were and some also withdrew from my bank account even though I asked them to STOP future via EFT Revocation Letters. A Couple withdrew funds directly from my account even after it was Bank closed causing me to incur heavy bank fees per day of even {$50.00} or {$60.00} at certain intervals. This was a very stressful time during months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX causing us to be fragmented and close to homeless situation."

She stated I could mail in my money order for {$1000.00} since I was having trouble paying at the stores and send the remaining {$270.00} by XX/XX/XXXX since I 'd already had an agreement to pay XXXX. This was also due to my account being frozen and the difficulty involved going back to withdraw additional funds. So on XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a money order for XXXX and mailed it to the address I was given. I called Ace after doing so to let them know the payment was in route and also to confirm my remaining balance of {$270.00} and let them know when I would be mailing it off as well. I got someone named XXXX on the phone who said my remaining balance was over {$500.00}. I was livid. I told her the entire history of the account, what I was told was due and everything. From this point on the runaround was horrible. Whenever I called I was always placed on hold for over an hour and when I did speak to someone they refused to acknowledge the payment they had already received. They gave me a different balance each time. Finally I told them never to call me again and that I would be sending the XXXX money order that I was originally quoted and Ace Cash Expres would not receive any additional money from me. I did n't understand why I had to split my payments that way anyway when on my first phone call I was prepared to pay it off in full.   So on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I did exactly as requested and purchased a money order for XXXX. I did n't mail it off until XX/XX/XXXX because I kept trying to reach someone in a position of authority to acknowledge the payment amount before I would send it.   For months I did n't hear from them anymore but yesterday I received a letter from a collection agency by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX asking for a payment of XXXX on behalf of Ace Cash Express. This is now harassment. They can not give me an amount then after I pay it ask for more money. I am seeking legal advise and plan to file a lawsuit. This harassment is out of control.

1,0.7279513478279114,278,"This "" lender '' is very interesting. First they start by approving XXXX for a loan. They ask what one 's paydays are. Then they set up the loan repayment schedule so that the payments are processed the day before the payday -- hoping, I assume, that the payment wo n't be honored, which will force the borrower to pay more fees for late payment.   Second, instead of a stead payment schedule, the borrower makes XXXX payments of X-dollars in "" finance fees ''. For my {$400.00} loan, this means I will pay {$700.00} in finance fees before ANYTHING is applied to the principle -- basically this is negative amortization, at a going rate of 798 %. ( Yes, SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY-EIGHT percent. ) Third, after the finance fees, the payment balloons -- it 's 10 % larger for no real reason. Again, my assumption is that this ballooning of the payment structure is to make it more likely to engender some kind of overdraft/late payment situation.   Finally, they fail to disclose this information in any meaningful sense. It was n't until I had the loan that I was able to review these terms and conditions.

1,0.6589938998222351,318,"On Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I routinely checked my bank accounts for balance and cleared payments. At that time, I checked XXXX XXXX Bank - which showed a deposit of {$1100.00} ( see attached. ) I did not apply for, go online thinking about applying for, or call or write anyone in any attempt to get any payday or other loan. So I went directly to my bank, asked them how this company has access to deposit money in my account? The bank would only tell me that the transaction was authorized. So I closed that account with them and re-opened a new account.   The lender is CashNet USA or similar name. The loan looks like it was deposited on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - to XXXX in XXXX ( XXXX branch ) .I am a XXXX resident, and was born and raised here. After speaking with XXXX office last week, I was advised that currently this company does not have a license to 'lend money ' to anyone residing here. ( CashNet USA 's website also confirms this.   I should say that from about XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX, I did in fact have a loan through CashNet, but paid it off in full and have documents from CashNet to prove it.   So, someone went online and applied for a loan in my name. This current loan lists the account # XXXX which is the same account # on my payoff documents.   What benefit is it to a criminal to apply for a payday loan under a someone else 's name when i 'm sure at some point they had to be told the funds would be deposited into the pre-existing bank account -- that the criminal could n't access?   How did CashNet still have authorization to access my bank account in the first place - after i closed my account with them?   How did CashNet issue a loan in XXXX when it does n't have a license to do so, and it 's a prohibited practice in XXXX?   And now I 'm FORCED to take action, and lose time from work etc.   I believe CashNet, through some layers of deception, deposited this money on purpose in hopes I 'd just and pay them.   I did not sign anything, and whoever acted to make this current 'loan ' apparently relied on old data on me from my previous loan - ( in which i was living in XXXX with a XXXX licence and car registration ). In making this 'loan ', CashNet should have ( by law or just due dilligence ) bothered to verify who i am, current employer, address, phone, etc. on me including public records of me moving to XXXX, changing car title and registration, and my driver 's license.   Instead it appears they choose to 'slam ' me with this loan, and now expect me to pay back at usuary rates.   This is no different than XXXX XXXX standing on a street corner and one SHOVES money in your pocket while the other yells "" Yeah, that 's {$1100.00} there - and now you owe us {$5000.00} in interest, fees, and principle.

Although I did receive a copy of an agreement for the loan ( which is not an original copy of the signed agreement since the originals bear my signature and the copies they gave me do not ) the information/details were not communicated verbally. On around XXXX XXXX, 2016 I went to the store and spoke to XXXX that I had found my agreement of XXXX XXXX, 2016 and pointed out that the due date was not until XXXX XXXX, 2016.

He said he could not promise anything but regardless of the answer he would call me on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, 2016. I called XXXX on Tuesday at XXXX and left him a message reminding him that he stated that he would call. XXXX did not call. The main issue is that within the period of XXXX XXXX, 2016 - XXXX XXXX, 2016 I ended up paying twice the fees and interest on the same loan when I should have been allowed to NOT renew the agreement on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Instead it was deceitfully extended and the company ended up double dipping into the fees for the same time period.

For three weeks after, Cash Net continued to debit my account for the amount of the payments. Cash Net was contacted, sent copies of the cancelled check, but still refused to quit taking money from my account. I wrote them a letter and included a copy of the cancelled check and they then sent my account to XXXX collection agency. They called me today and their agent, XXXX XXXX, told me if I did not pay them XXXX right then, I would be arrested and could be detained for up to 60 days unless a judge allowed bail. They then said that they would settle for XXXX at XXXX. I tried to explain to them that the debt had been paid, proof had been sent to them, and the agent then said he was a mediator and not a collection agency, yet he refused to listen to what I had to say. I then paid the {$700.00} due to a fear of being arrested. I have proof of payment so now Cash Net has been paid XXXX times for the same debt.

Every two weeks I visited the store and paid off the loan. I would repeat the loan every two weeks because I kept falling behind with my other expenses. Paying the loan back would make me repeat right away to get back on track. I did not give the lender access to my bank account. Instead I would go in every two weeks to pay and repeat the loan.   XX/XX/2013, I did not have enough money to continue repeating this loan. I fell at work and did not have a steady income. I was not able to pay back the last loan I took out because the lack of income made it difficult to pay for my basic expenses. Let alone paying back the loan. My family and basic expenses came first. After I stopped visiting the store and making the payments, California Check Cashing called my home to let me know that I had a pending debt.   Even though I wanted to pay my debt and prevent any damage to my credit, I simply did not have the money to do so. I owed {$300.00} and a few months after I did not return, I received a letter. This time it was not California Check Cashing, bit rather a collection agency that was asking me to pay back what I owed. They gave me options to pay back that loan along with another one from a separate lender I had also borrowed from.   The week I received that letter I was expecting to work some extra hours at my new job. I thought I would make enough during those extra hours to pay off the loans. However, everything changed last minute and I was not given the extra hours. I do want to pay off the loan, but need them to work with me and give me a payment plan that I can actually afford."

Now, instead of leaving them a check, they enter your full account info into their system ( essentially allowing them to access your account directly however and whenever they feel lke it ).   The loan is also supplied differently. No cash. Instead, they give you a third-party debit card ( which I need like a hole in the head ), supposedly containing the amount of your loan. I took that card to XXXX banks that day and it was declined each time. I went back to the store in an absolute rage, telling them I wanted the contract torn up.

0,0.27236413955688477,464,"This is a long read but please bear with me as the details are important.  1 ) My federal student loans were transferred from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I am on the income driven PAYE plan and also enrolled in public service loan forgiveness. I recertified my income and payment amount in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX. We made one payment, under this new certification, of {$130.00} to XXXX XXXX before the loans were transferred to XXXX. I only transferred them because we enrolled in the PSLF plan.  When the loans were transferred to XXXX XXXX, they told us that they would honor the recertification payment amount of {$130.00}. We have documentation of the payments made in the amount of {$130.00} to XXXX XXXX and they were on time payments.  They gave us a due date on the XXXX  every month. We knew this payment would be increasing over the years so we wanted the due date to be moved to the XXXX of every month. We called and asked XXXX XXXX if we could change the due date to the XXXX every month. We made our payment on XX/XX/XXXX in full. We called on XX/XX/XXXX to change the following month 's payment to the XXXX  and every month thereafter. It would be XX/XX/XXXX for the first higher payment amount based on the website payment. However, the notice we received now says that it goes into effect on XX/XX/XXXX. This inconsistent information is exactly why we are complaining.  The complaint is that they are now charging a higher payment and no one said that our payment would be higher simply by changing the payment due date to the XXXX. We feel that they are abusing their power and unfairly charging us a higher amount even though we have recertified and 12 months have not passed. We are only in month 4 and they increased our payments. We had no change in family size or income. They claim that the system recalculated the payment amount when they changed the due date. They refused to manually change the payment back to the original amount of {$130.00}. We feel that they are unfairly charging us a higher amount of monthly payments before we actually recertified. Their system is recalculating payments and is against the department of education 's guidelines for recertification and payment changes.  2 ) When the loans were transferred in XX/XX/XXXX, it immediately went into forbearance which we did not request. We asked to make a payment in XXXX but the lady on the phone told us we were not allowed to make a payment because it wouldn't count. This is all recorded over the phone. Now, the notices show us as missing a payment but this is simply not true. The loan said it was in forbearance. We can easily pay the required amount but we were directly told to not apply a payment until they could remove the forbearance status. Any and all mishandlings related to this forbearance need to be cleared. We obviously don't want to be in forbearance if we're trying to make the 120 qualifying payments as quickly as possible."

Again, we were notified that we were being charged an annual fee for the cards in question.

I was assured that the matter would be corrected.   We have received two mores notice that we are being charged a fee for the cards in question - even though we had never formally activated the cards, no charges had been incurred, and your assurances the issue had been resolved. As per past exchanges : ( 1 ) The cards in question have never been formally activated. ( 2 ) The cards were physically destroyed. ( 3 ) No charges have ever been made to the cards in question.

We are retired and live a very modest lifestyle. This issue has caused us considerable stress. We have always paid legitimate bills and maintain a positive credit rating. We have attempted to positively resolve this issue, but it seems that your company insists that we pay for a service we have never used and benefits we have never received. I again respectfully request that all charges related to the cards in question be removed without negatively affecting our credit rating.   Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"

I look at the reports to find out that this furniture co. called XXXX XXXX has my acct. still posted as charged off and refuse to submit updated info that I have been now paying on the same acct. that XXXX reported charged off. I think that is totally unfair to keep me penalized for something that I am now trying to make good on. furthermore ... I think its is only fair the XXXX now submit updates info that I have renegotiated another deal with their company to get the debt that had charged off to now status of going towards being paid off and has being paying as agree. XXXX refuse to do update reporting whereas as I am as a paying citizen am entitled as earning credit status towards paying off. XXXX XXXX can care less that this method they are doing to me is indeed hurting me.   I am now mad about this and want to now return their furniture and leave the acct. just charge off. I have been paying this company now again for almost close to a year and they refuse to give me a decent credit score an report that I am now re- established credit or at least open me a new acct # whereas they can now report my credit status with their company whereas it shows that I am now in the process of paying this old acct. they have listed as charged off acct. with change status as being up to date and is currently making payments.

I wanted to contact you in reference to my credit rating with XXXX furniture?  apparently XXXX furniture has me charged off on the credit bureau reports and Im very upset by that because Im paying you guys money and have been paying you money for almost over a year somewhere close to a year of not over a year? Bill should be somewhat close to being almost paid off I mean seriously?  Im really disappointed at the fact that nobody has reported and told the truth not updated my information with all credit bureaus ... However ; being that all three credit bureaus contacted me and I saw no currently updates Ive decided to file a disputed issue about XXXX not updating that they are receiving current payments. This is unfair.  so XXXX XXXX will be getting notified about a dispute because nothing has been updated and I dont think I deserve this at all. You all need to go ahead on and update my credit reports I did re- establishment credit and did get things started back off with you guys again plus I renegotiated a payment I can afford to pay off my bill. With that being said, that stuff needs to be updated thus fairly documented. I can not believe this! I am so hurt over that I have worked so hard to try to bounce back with your company. The credit report rating is very unfair and very untrue Im hoping you can get in touch with the necessary party to fix that and have them update my information?  look at this attachment that I am sending you thank you so much have a good week.   XXXX email Response XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( 10 hours ago ) to me XXXX, Thank you for contacting us.  The account that we have in our office was charged off XX/XX/XXXX for non-payment. Yes you have made payment arrangements to settle the account, but once an account is charged off, it will only be reported in one of two ways, charged off or paid in full.  We still show a balance of {$900.00} with the last payment having been made on XX/XX/XXXX. So in short, your account is reporting correctly as there is an unpaid balance on a charged off account.  If you have indeed submitted a dispute, we will handle that through the appropriate channels.If you do have any additional questions, feel free to contact our office.

0,0.16325372457504272,536,"On XX/XX/XXXX, CFPB notified me that it sent complaint ID # XXXX to the company, Suntrust Mortgage .  On XX/XX/XXXX, Suntrust Mortgage responded ( see attached ). In paragraph 4, the writer states : "" Your loan was on a forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. '' Under the CARES Act of XX/XX/XXXX, Suntrust Mortgage has committed a criminal violation of federal policy.  According to Suntrust records of the account at issue, all mortgage payments were paid timely through XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX closed the entire state until further notice due to the pandemic. On XX/XX/XXXX, President Trump signed the CARES Act of XX/XX/XXXX/ In Suntrust 's correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see attached ), all clients were notified that "" [ I ] f you loan is a federally-backed mortgage loan ... .you are entitled to an initial forbearance period for up to twelve ( 12 ) months. You can also entitled to extend your total forbearance period for up to twelve ( 12 ) months. '' So, my forbearance period began on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, my total forbearance period extends through XX/XX/XXXX.  Under federal law, my next payment due date is XX/XX/XXXX.  Suntrust 's own correspondence is proof of its federal law violation.  In its XX/XX/XXXX attachment, Ms. XXXX XXXX writes : "" On XX/XX/XXXX, we applied {$3100.00} from suspense toward the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments, leaving {$830.00} in suspense. '' Suntrust deceptively applied client 's funds to a XX/XX/XXXX payment that does NOT exist pursuant to the CARES Act of XX/XX/XXXX.  Suntrust further placed client 's funds in a "" SUSPENSE '' account on at least nine ( 9 ) continuous occasions as verified by its XX/XX/XXXX correspondence in VIOLATION of federal law.  Ms. XXXX XXXX, Officer, Client Resolution Senior Specialist Client-Advocacy, further writes : "" On the same day, we disbursed {$3700.00} for taxes ''.  Under federal law, any disbursement for taxes must come with full disclosure of client 's funds. Here, Suntrust failed to provide its client with full disclosure of client funds disbursed for taxes from a "" SUSPENSE '' account in violation of federal law.  Suntrust continues to place client 's funds in an illegal "" SUSPENSE '' account due to its illegality of attempting to establish an escrow account that does not exist.  In the XX/XX/XXXX CFPB response ( paragraph 4 ), Suntrust 's officer, Ms. XXXX, states that "" [ O ] n XX/XX/XXXX, another notice was mailed to you to advise the delinquent taxes were paid and an escrow account was established for the life of the loan in accordance with the Deed of Trust. This information is also stated on the signed Escrow Waiver ''.  Ms. XXXX is referring to paragraph 7 of the Escrow Waiver already on file with CFPB.  However, the delinquent taxes were paid by Suntrust and was also covered by the CARES Act of XX/XX/XXXX.  Under the legal doctrine of UNJUST ENRICHMENT, Suntrust CAN NOT benefit twice during a pandemic whereby most mortgagers nationwide were similarly situated through no fault of their own.  Hence, paragraph 7 refers to "" fault of your own ''. Therefore, Suntrust has NO legal authority to create an ESCROW account without the consent of the client."

The file went through initial underwriting normally with the underwriting team responding back with Conditions that should be met before the loan would be approved. The conditions were suspicious and seemed to have nothing reasonably to do with ensuring my ability to pay the loan or complying with FHA guidelines. Some of them seemed very targeted and arbitrary, but none the less, I complied and completed every requested including pay off a tax obligation that was 1. not yet due 2. was not in collections 3 did not interfere whatsoever with the company 's ability to secure first position with the mortgage. The night after closing was suppose to happen, the underwriter seemed to question a document that I sent months ago that she approved. THe document referred to my student loan payment that was in forebearance due to a federal legislative act. She took issue with the document disclosing an "" estimated '' payment instead of actual payment after forebearance. Because it said estimated and not the actual payment, she inputed a payment that is 4-5 times the estimated payment. This imputation that clearly at odds with evidence and what is reasonable, took me out of appropriate DtI which is now the bases for denial. I believe, and have said multiple times that I am being discriminated against in this loan."

XXXX was shocked to hear that I was told I have to handle the investigation and encouraged me to call back because that was absurd.   Over the next couple of days Capital One made an absolute mess of my card charging me and then crediting me back over and over again and charging me twice for the {$72.00} processing fee. I called Capital One back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a new representative. I asked her about all the charging and crediting back to my card and went through my story again. She told me she showed that all transactions were marked fraudulent and still under investigation. She explained the {$72.00} fee could not be credited back until they concluded their investigation and apologized for the other representative 's behavior.   On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Capital One stating they concluded their investigation and determined the Cash Advance charge was not fraudulent and that I would be responsible for paying it on my next bill.   I again waited a few days and decided to call Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. I ran through the events again with the new representative and she then alerted me to the fact that a replacement card was called in on XX/XX/XXXX and sent to my house. I never called in a replacement card and was never notified ( by email or phone ) that a new card was headed my way. Sure enough I pulled up video camera footage and have proof that someone stole the mail from my house which contained the Capital One replacement card. The representative I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX made note of this and said she would remark the charges as fraud.   I am exhausted and tired of doing Capital One 's job for them. It has been 11 days of back and forth with no real answers as to what Capital One will do got remedy this situation. I am very frustrated that it took talking to 5 employees before being notified a replacement card was sent out. I am even more frustrated that Capital One does not have a better system in place to notify/confirm people 's identities and alert them of things like this. Calling the customer on the phone number they have on file to notify them when a replacement card is being sent out, sending an email to the email on file to notify someone, or even putting an alert on the account ( mobile and online ) that a replacement card has been sent out could prevent things like this happening. It should not be on the customer to investigate the fraudulent charges for Capital One."
0,0.05935311317443848,551,"On XX/XX/21 I applied to Citi for a new consumer credit card. Citi denied the card under fraudulent representations of fact. Citi pulled a consumer credit report and claimed to deny the application in full or in part based on the data provided. This however directly contradicts their own cited rational for the denial. Over 11 years ago, I did declare bankruptcy - a bankruptcy that Citi is using against me. Citi does not disclose or acknowledge that a bankruptcy will create a denial. This is exceptionally misleading as the credit bureau on which Citi relied could not report a bankruptcy as it was more than 10 years ago fully discharged. Citi also claimed that current accounts have a history of late payments - a claim factually repudiated by the very credit report on which Citi claims to have relied and show a perfect payment history. Further Citi cited a restricted credit priviledge on existing accounts ; such information is not part of the credit bureau record.   Citi, pulled a credit report and claimed to rely on that data, but rather than truthfully use that data they relied solely on their own records to deny credit. These are terms which could and should have been readily disclosed in the application, there was no reason to pull a report when they intended to deny the application on internal data alone and reasons that could have easily been avoided by the applicant.   Further, Citi provide and XXXX number for questions and assistance. The number for customer service and the number provided on the credit denial both resulted in numerous automated system hangups and no ability to reach a real person or obtain staffed service hours. The number provided is merely an automated system that will not connect to a person, hangs up on you when it is done reading the already sent letter verbatim. The is not customer service, it is the complete lack of service.   Because I have another account with Citi, I was able to access the fraud department on XXXX, which connected to a real person. Connecting a real person in applications, remained a time consuming challenge."

Doing so has raised my student loan interest rate by .25 percent. Prior to the faulty deferment I had a .25 reduction in my interest rate for using their direct debit service, and deferring my loans without my permission raises my interest rate again back up .25 percent. They claim that the Department of Education automatically defers my loans. I don't see how this is right or fair.   Additionally, there is a form that I can fill out according to XXXX XXXX which will prevent this from happening. They said it would be available to my XXXX account last week so I can prevent future deferrals without my permission. I had to call about it and write to them multiple times since XX/XX/XXXX and I have still not received the form. On the latest call, they said that someone had made a mistake and asked me what my favorite color was to distract me. They eventually told me that in 24 -48 hours, after three weeks of calling, that my form would then be available. So I am still waiting. Meanwhile, my interest is higher and I am out of the direct debit option to reduce my payments.   Lastly, I was not informed of this "" form '' until the 4th time this automatic deferral has happened.   I see this as a way XXXX XXXX can collect more money from borrowers unlawfully.   2. A prior problem : I was on the Income Driven Repayment plan and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Plan for the first two years of my repayment for my XXXX degree, and I can say the XXXX XXXX always took a very long time to process any paperwork, meaning my Income Driving Replayment plan status, etc., was not put in place when I requested it due to their lengthy processing time.   I have since opted out of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Plan due to the possibility of legislators getting rid of it, which would mean my payments would be even greater. My experience with this loan servicing provider has been terrible. I feel their negligence has cost me more money.   Thank you for your time in reading my complaint.   Kind regards, XXXX XXXX"

We were able to go through HAMP, and have been doing ok until his contract position ended in XX/XX/XXXX. I can not pay the mortgage on my own, so we were going to give the loss mitigation process another shot. We filled out the necessary paperwork and we were denied assistance, not meeting criteria. I appealed the decision in XXXX of this year and we lost the appeal. At this point, we were due for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. We had to be delinquent to request help. Now we are faced with catching ourselves up, or losing our home. I received a letter stating we needed to make a payment of {$5100.00} by XX/XX/XXXX, then I received a letter stating we needed to make a payment of $ {$6600.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and advised I would be making 3 full payments that week, and the remainder of amount due by the following Friday. I was advised that would be fine and the agent noted my account of my intentions. I made a payment of {$1500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and 20, totaling {$4700.00}. Those payments were received on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX. I noticed the payments were not posted, so I first called on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX to ask why they were not posting to the account. The agent told me it may just take a few days and that I should check back, due to the status of the account. I called back on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX and was told that I could not split the amount up, that it should have been paid in one lump sum. I was never told this. The letter I received from the bank did not contain this information, nor did the agent onXX/XX/XXXX tell me this. Had that been the case, I would have waited until the following Friday to pay the entire amount. The agent on Friday said he would send an email to the department that had the funds and find out what they planned to do with them. According to him, that was the only way to contact this department. I checked back later that afternoon for an update, and there was none. This agent told me there was a possibility the money would post since it was full three payments and got me under my 30 day late threshold. She also told me to check back. I called back today and was advised my money posted to a report to be held for 7 days, then returned to me by check. I have not gotten the same answer at all, except for the fact the money had to be paid in a lump sum. The agent today read the notes to me from my XX/XX/XXXX  call. It clearly stated what I was going to do. But, she said since it was not entered as an accepted promise, it did not matter. Even though the agent told me it would be fine to send it that way. I requested a supervisor, but was told that the notes on the account were from a supervisor, so I was not allowed to speak with one. She told me they would reach out to that department for an update. Now I am looking at a XX/XX/XXXXdeadline to cure this amount, or pay additional fees or face foreclosure. I have no idea what they are doing with my {$4700.00}. And I have the additional money to add to that to pay the {$6600.00}. I am so scared I will end up losing my house because I was not told how that money needed to come in.

In their last email response to me on XX/XX/XXXX, they stated "" After re-investigating the account, we are still unable to honor this claim because when you first filed this claim, you stated the transactions were unauthorized and you did not authorize any of these payments to the merchant and also had your debit card closed and answered the questionnaire for unauthorized transactions. These are steps that are taken anytime an unauthorized transaction is reported. Now you are stating the transactions were authorized but have since either been canceled or you have not received the items. Based on the inconsistent information provided throughout this case, we are still unable to honor this claim. '' They are refusing to fully investigate my claim because they are stating that I changed my story/reason for the overcharges. This is not accurate. The Venmo represented who filed the claim, after listening to me explain what happened, suggested that I frame the claim that way. I did only what the Venmo representative suggested. Further, when I called back to Venmo, the agent stated that "" I do not know why the denied the claim. It seems they coded it wrong in the system, I will send them a note. '' A day letter, they denied the claim again.   This issue started when I got a Venmo debit card. The way the card works, if I charge on the card {$18.00} for gas, Venmo will round up and take {$20.00} out of your account and put the balance in your Venmo balance.   BetweenXX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, I used the card extensively to track my business purchases ( at least 500 transactions, if not more ). When I used the card to book rideshare rides with ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) those merchants pre-authorize your card for the estimated cost. So if I booked a ride with XXXX, they would say the cost is going to be {$6.00} and they would preauthorize this on the card. Venmo would then take {$10.00} out of my account immediately. However, if I canceled the ride or didn't take the ride for some reason, the money has already been pulled out of my account, but it wasn't put back into the wallet.   THis happened to me on numerous occasions. I documented all of the times I was overcharged and attempted to file a claim for reimbursement.

According to the notice, in XX/XX/XXXX my parents took out a loan for {$40000.00} from XXXX XXXX, to remodel the house. At that time, BOTH of my parents were retired, living on a combined Social Security of about {$1100.00} - {$1200.00} per month. Their payment was to have been over {$500.00} per month, and would last until XX/XX/XXXX, when my mother would have been XXXX years old. On top of that, the interest on the loan was 8.725 %. My father then passed away in XX/XX/XXXX, leaving my mom to make these payments on her SS check of slightly over {$600.00} per month. In XX/XX/XXXX, they made an agreement to lower the payment, but extend the loan until XX/XX/XXXX, when my mother would have been XXXX years old! As I said, both of my parents had retired years before taking out this loan. In addition, both of them had TERRIBLE credit! Why would anyone give a loan like this to someone, under these conditions. Also, I see that one of the stipulations in the loan is that they will not let the property deteriorate. At the time of the loan, the west wall of the house had already detached from the rest of the house. The floor on that end of the house was sinking into the crawlspace. The ceiling in the attached garage was caving in. If XXXX XXXX  had bothered to look at the house in advance, there is no way they would have given this loan to my parents. My mother was able to pay off only about {$10000.00} of the loan before she died, and the house is now being foreclosed on. As we work to settle her estate, the house and contents will be sold, but most of the money will go to settle this debt. I feel that allowing my XXXX and XXXX year old parents to take out this large loan on a house that should have been condemned should be considered a "" predatory loan '', and the loan should be forgiven."

Accordingly, I address each particular issue directly with the creditor in question, before submitting any complaint to the credit bureaus if necessary. Therefore, I desire the following reinvestigation as follows : 1 ) On accounts where late payments are  posted, I respectfully request a review of the past payment history and to ascertain if certain payments could actually have been posted late because of an overlap on the 30-days grace period. I realize that this may happen on occasion, and I request only a summary review internally, and do not require any documentation.  2 ) On any account that falls within the 84-month negative reporting timeline, I respectfully request either the deletion of the account if said account was closed, or the elimination of the prior payment if the account it is still active, this is well within the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) guidelines pertaining to obsolete information.  3 ) Any collections must be proved if either a direct collection and/or debt purchase. In either event I request that a true original copy of right to pursue collection be established with each respective credit reporting agency, and if a debt purchase the guidelines proving transfer of ownership must be submitted to all  credit bureaus as well as me personally to validate ownership and the right to collect. I am well within my rights requesting proper documentation as administered through the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), in addition to the even stricter guidelines enforced by the office of attorney general in my state of domicile.

On XXXX XXXX, two days later, the property was placed under contract with the closing date set for XX/XX/2019. At this point, the lending agency, Rushmore, was contacted to ensure closing protocols were in place. An inquiry was made concerning the upcoming XXXX mortgage payment. We asked if the final payment that would be made upon closing would suffice in lieu of XXXX 's mortgage payment. We also asked if this would create a negative report on our credit. We were assured by Rushmore that the final payment upon closing would be acceptable and that no negative report would be made showing a missed payment. As such, a final payoff amount was requested to complete closing paperwork. However, Rushmore failed to submit the final payoff as requested by both the loan holder and the closing attorney. This resulted in a delay in payment. Upon closing, the closing attorney secured an anticipated payoff amount from the purchasing lending agency and held all funds awaiting Rushmore 's response. Numerous requests were submitted by both us ( the loan holder ) and the closing attorney. We were informed by Rushmore that the payoff amount could not be emailed nor provided over the phone. It had to be faxed, which they failed to complete. After weeks of repeated attempts, the secured payment that was being held was finally made and we were assured that any overage would be reimbursed. In addition to the delay, Rushmore, in turn, reported missed mortgage payment ( s ) causing a negative impact on our credit score. As of recent, we are still receiving notices and mail at our current address offering assistance with our missed mortgage payment ( s ).

I would ask them to put this information into the computer but it seems that they couldn't or wouldn't. divorce trial was XX/XX/2020 in which my wife was awarded the house. The equity in the house was lost due to the forbearance. divorce decree was for me to quit claim the deed. Her court order was to make the mortgage payments.  In XXXX I look at the mortgage and it shows she signed another 3 months of forbearance. I talked again with the mortgage company and they had continued to put both of our names on the monthly statements and that they needed my financial statements that I would have to sign a loan modification and be out of forbearance for 3 months before I could come off the loan.

0,0.16165012121200562,777,"The company is Roundpoint Mortgage.  In XX/XX/XXXX I accidentally double paid my mortgage for the month. Shortly after, I requested a refund for the second mortgage payment. Once I realized the refund wouldnt be another direct deposit, I asked for the cancellation of the refund and to have the funds applied for XX/XX/XXXX payment instead. At first, the request was noted, however another agent already processed the cashiers check and therefore voided the initial stop refund request. This incident is what initiated my problems with roundpoint mortgage.  Once the cashiers check was issued, I requested for customer service reps to void the check and apply the funds to XX/XX/XXXX payment. I requested this process more than 10 times. Each time, I was told it would be done only to find out my request was never documented or initiated on my account.  To make a long story short, roundpoint held on to XX/XX/XXXX payment for 115 days. Within those 115 days, roundpoint gave me a {$75.00} late fee, and added a delinquency notice on my credit report which made my credit fall by more than 100 points.  It wasnt until 90 days in to my problem, that roundpoint finally acknowledged their error, fixed my credit and removed the late fee. They even sent a long apology letter ensuring the issue was resolved. However, the company still took 3 more weeks to actually apply XX/XX/XXXX payment. Therefore, ( to my current problem ), Im dealing with another -150 point hit to my credit report, and foreclosure warning letters from the company.  I once again asked the company to dispute the company error with the credit bureaus, but as far as I know, my request is being disregarded again.  Ive had my loan since XX/XX/XXXX, every mortgage payment has been made on time since then. Ive tried almost everything I can think of to get the company to resolve these issues and close out the account but the company neglects my complaints and refuses to expedited resolving my concerns.  I am afraid I may have to take more extreme measures to fight this company."

When I got there I informed the 1st person that talked to me his name was XXXX that I had emailed with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and that I had my own financing of up to {$14000.00} he joking said {$15000.00}. He got XXXX out to talk to me and I informed him of the financing and he opened the vehicle for us to look at. XXXX comes out and I tell him about my financing and then XXXX comes back and says you do not want this vehicle it takes synthetic oil and premium gas. Ok I was getting ready to leave as I only came in to test drive the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX SUV. XXXX says come in and let me see if Nissan has better interest rates than XXXX. He said it would be maybe a half point on the credit score as he  was doing soft inquiry. I also explained to him that I was still shopping and had an appointment to see a vehicle in XXXX XXXX at a dealer I also explained this to XXXX when I saw him, I was only doing preliminary shopping for a used SUV. I also told him if he had a used manual transmission on the lot he needed to get rid of to let me know. He gets my information and disappears for about 30 minutes. When he comes back I specifically asked him are you checking with BANKS on my behalf and he said NO and left again and went back into another office. Another 30 minutes passes and I was getting ready to leave as I did not think it took that long to find out what Nissan interest rates were. He then takes me over to XXXX XXXX desk and XXXX writes on a scrap piece of paper that he can get me a XX/XX/XXXX new XXXX XXXX  manual transmission for {$480.00}. a month.

I laughed even more I thought this was all rather funny as I had told him now on several occasions that I had my own financing even showing both XXXX and XXXX the email from XXXX and that I was still shopping and had plans to see more used SUV 's in the next several days. He said we can get you the new XXXX XXXX manual transmission for {$11000.00}. and it will be {$480.00} a month. I said no thanks and left. My XXXX year old son was with me and will attest to these facts also. The next day XXXX calls up and says good new we can get you in the Versa for {$390.00} a month I was like what ... I told him that I had already told him on several occasions I was not ready to buy nor was I shopping for a new vehicle. Then I get notification from my bank that several hard inquiries had been run on my credit. I contacted the 3 lending institutions that I saw and inquired if any were Nissan financing none were. I contacted the manager of the dealership to give him a chance to correct this wrong. He said he was not there that day and he would check for me. He called back and said that XXXX had not informed the assistant manager that was there that day that I had my own financing nor did he tell him that I was shopping for a used vehicle. That XXXX had informed him that I desperately needed a vehicle. I did not give any one permission to try to get me financing nor did anyone ever ascertain from me the terms I would want to obtain a loan or even how much down payment I had as this information was already in my loan application with my bank XXXX and I had been approved for a loan through them for up to {$14000.00}. on a used vehicle of my choice. The manager said he would not contest when I sent my letters to the credit bureau that they ran unauthorized loan applications without permission using my information. But I find this practice very unethical and they lied to me and I am sure running someone's credit information without permission is wrong and should be prosecuted. I have further received a letter from XXXX that says they declined to give me a loan. I called them and told them I did not apply for a loan with them. They were not interested in finding out that XXXX XXXX  XXXX Georgia ran this without my permission. It would seem that every bank that XXXX XXXX  XXXX Georgia pulled into this scheme of illegal behavior would also be culpable. I am not sure of the number of times they applied for credit for me without my permission or knowing how much I had to put down or any terms that I would want to complete a loan. The manager said XXXX never checked Nissan financing and that would only take a phone call and he did not need my information to ascertain the interest rates from Nissan. This seems to have been deceptive from the beginning nor has anyone informed me the interest rate or any other relevant information that I would need to make a determination. This was deceit from the beginning and these actions have been detrimental to me.

0,0.3132393956184387,845,"Good afternoon CFPB, I want to thank you and advance for your help and support regarding my request for short sale on my current property. I had initially been attempting to get a mortgage modification on my home. It was clear the mortgage company was unwilling to provide one. They actually approved me for a trial modification years back which I paid each monthly in a timely fashion for 10 months while awaiting permanent approval. Then they notified me via a letter that permanent approval was denied. More recently I was again approved for a modification, however, it was based on a fictitious annual earning which was "" literally '' double our household earnings. After pointing out the earnings error several times they then reduced our annual approval value to {$8600.00} per monthlystill far more than our monthly earnings of {$5600.00} which we had clearly stated n multiple occasions. Because we would not be able to pay the monthly mortgage which was based on a modification using erroneous monthly earnings we opted not move forward with the mortgage modification which only reduced our mortgage payment by {$86.00} per month and extended our mortgage another 21 years ( we have documentation verifying all of this ).  After realizing they would not provide us with a real modification we opted to pursue a Short Sale.  They are now recycling us in a never ending cycle of submitting the same paperwork. I have provided Shellpoint Mortgage Services the requested paperwork no less than 10 times. Each and every time the process comes to the same result whereby Shellpoint Mortgage Services ultimately tells me they need the same documents filled out over and over again and threatens to take me to court. I have an extensive email trail I can provide as a proof source for this. Additionally, I have verified with the Loss Mitigation division of Shellpoint mortgage services that the conversations we are having, and their request for information, are being recorded. In these conversations I have verified with them if the email they are currently requesting is provided that will meet all of their needs for documentation. This is the 10th time I have provided them with what they have requested yet they are telling me they need different documentation. The realtor and mortgage company that I have used no longer wants to work with this company.  I am writing to request your support yet again to get this issue resolved so I can move on with my life in a positive and productive manner. This is having on toll emotional hardship on myself, my children and my marriage which ended up resulting in a divorce on XX/XX/XXXX mainly to do with all of the problems associated with our living environment.   This is a copy of the last email I provided Shellpoint Dear Shellpoint Mortgage, I can say in all honesty the Short Sales and Modification process through Shellpoint Mortgage Services is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in my life. For years now I have been attempting to either get a mortgage modification or a short sale on my current residence. Each and every time you send me a packet of information to fill out. Each and every time I fill out that information. And each and every time I am forced to go through a painful process up continuously providing you with that same information over and over again, piecemeal.  I am initially sent a packet stating you have received my modification packet or short sale request packet and it is being reviewed. Then sometime later I receive an additional mailing stating the packet is in complete and you want this form or that document, which by the way was already provided. I then follow up with those documents and you tell me now you need additional documentation. You might either be requesting additional documents which you have already been sent or you could be stating that documents which you have received are now out of date etc.   As you can see from the email below dated Friday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  I had a conversation with you XXXX, after having a conversation on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX and during that conversation I was told you needed three documents which are outlined in that conversation.

Experian has made it nearly impossible to access my free credit report, instead it gives me a continual run-around, ultimately requiring me to physically mail documents ( not free ), to receive my report. While XXXX  and XXXX issued my report without complications, Experian gives one disingenuous excuse after another ... first, "" my current address isn't an exact match '' which shouldn't be the case if both XXXX and XXXX had no issue with my address. Then, Experian gave me the option of uploading "" proof of identity '' documents such as my license and a current bill. I did so, and each time I clicked to upload and submit the documents I was given a new error ( which wasn't even stated an issue in the upload instructions ). The website states that both PDFs and TIFFs are acceptable formats, but, when I attempted to upload a photo of my license which as in color, it was denied because it had to be a gray-scale TIFF, which wasn't stated prior. The second time I uploaded a gray-scale TIFF, the file size was stated to be too large, again, the second file was smaller than the first, yet I was not instructed to submit a smaller image file. Finally, having corrected both of the aforementioned issues, on my third submission attempt I was redirected to a web page that stated I have exceeded my maximum number of attempts to upload the documents and that my free credit report request could only be processed by mail. Experian is truly the lowest common denominator of the credit reporting world, they make requests so complicated and difficult that most people would give up -- not to mention they try to trick you into paying for a report, even though I'm entitled to an annual report.

I even opened a repayment plan for all my student loans and this particular loan was missing from that list. This company, Heartland ECSI, did not. After I paid the loan in full, including all late fees, I requested the company to remove the late payments from my credit report since I did not have access to any of the notices about the payments. The company did not accept my request, in fact, they did not even consider it and they denied my right to speak to another person that could have the authority to help me with this. The customer service representative refused to transfer me to speak with somebody else and also refused to answer my questions clearly. It is my understanding that because I paid the loan in full already, they're refusing any other help with this account as well as my right to dispute the unfair late payment reports."

Two months later, in XXXX of XXXX, I signed up for XXXX XXXX XXXX 's auto-pay service, to assure prompt payments. Even though I had auto-pay, each month I received unnecessary mail from XXXX XXXX about the bill, advertising material, and offers. A year later, in XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX asking to GO PAPERLESS. They said they don't have Paperless. I replied that I don't need paper bills or offers from the company since I'm on auto-pay. The representative responded that they could stop communication, but I never had any understanding that I would never be notified under any circumstances.   Late last summer ( XXXX ), I misplaced my ATM card at home. I phoned the bank asking to put a hold on it until I found it. XXXX insisted that the card be canceled. Though I found the card the next morning, the card was canceled. It was an otherwise minor event but could haunt me for the next 7 years. THIS IS GROSSLY UNFAIR.   In XXXX of XXXX, when my ATM number didn't allow the payment to be pulled from my bank account, XXXX XXXX did nothing, and in XXXX they reported me as 30 days delinquent. This caused my CREDIT SCORE TO PLUMMET BY 70 POINTS. I found out from a credit reporting service I subscribe to and I quickly called XXXX XXXX and promptly paid them, as I have each month of the loan. Because the auto-pay was set up over a year back, I thought it pulled directly from my bank account, not through my ATM card.    When I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, asking that they reverse the 30 days late on my credit reports, because they never notified me that the auto-payment did not pull from my bank account, they replied that on XX/XX/XXXX, I had requested a "" Cease and Desist '' order, which I had never heard of.

Ninety days later, during the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I called Citibank to get a status on the {$700.00} Promotional bonus. I was informed by Citibank that the {$700.00} Promotional bonus would be available in my Citi Priority checking account within a few weeks.  In XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank to get a status on the {$700.00} Promotional bonus. I was informed by Citibank that the {$700.00} Promotional bonus would be available in my Citi XXXX checking account within a few weeks.  On XX/XX/XXXX I called Citibank to get a status on the {$700.00} Promotional bonus. I was informed by Citibank that due to a prior Citi Priority checking account ending in XXXX, as of XX/XX/XXXX I didnt qualify for the {$700.00} Promotional bonus. Victimized by Citibanks alleged grifting proclivities, I immediately went to a local Citibank to close my Citi Priority Checking and Savings accounts.  While waiting for the Citibank Teller to close my Checking and Savings accounts, I received a call [ XXXX ] from a woman representing the Citibank fraud department. The woman rudely stated that she had attached a fraud alert and had frozen the funds on my Citibank Checking and Savings accounts while I was waiting at the Citibank Tellers window. The Citibank fraud department woman then asked me if I was aware of any fraudulent activity relating to my Citi Priority Checking account.  I mentioned to the Citibank fraud department woman that I wasnt aware of any fraudulent activity and that I was standing at the Citibank Tellers window waiting an unusually long period of time for the Citibank Teller to close the Checking and Savings accounts and to combined the balances from the two accounts into one check. I wasnt aware that in a sneaky manner the Citibank fraud department woman was accusing me of fraud and was freezing the accounts that I was attempting to close.  I believe that the Citibank fraud department woman was intentionally delaying the closing of my Citibank Checking and Savings accounts in preparation for police intervention against me, while I was patiently waiting at the Citibank Tellers window. A XXXX  woman calling the Police to investigate alleged fraud activity linked to an XXXX-American male visiting a Citibank is an instant death sentence for the XXXX-American male.      Summary In an attempt to clean up a very XXXX and asinine event, the Citibank fraud department woman angrily stated that she would remove the fraud alert and release the funds from my Checking and Savings accounts.  Based specifically on my race, Citibank intentionally conned me into participating in a fraudulent scheme while vomiting an XXXX  attempt to create an alleged grifting issue by intentionally freezing my Checking and Savings accounts and initiating an asinine fraud alert and possible police intervention as a method to seize the funds from my Citibank Checking and Savings accounts that I was patiently waiting to close on XX/XX/XXXX.  Upon activation of my Citibank Priority Checking and Savings accounts on XX/XX/XXXX, Citibank intentionally refused to inform me that I wasnt eligible for the Citibank Priority {$700.00} promotion. Instead, Citibank forced an employee [ Sesan Ogunsemowo ] to lie and to cheat in order to find a way to confiscate funds from my Citi Priority Checking and Savings accounts.  If I were a XXXX  man, the above-mentioned Citibank employees wouldnt dare attempt to lie, steal and cheat in order to take financial advantage of what they perceived to be a XXXX  and XXXX  XXXX targeted by alleged grifters. This asinine and alleged grifting scheme concocted by Mr. XXXX XXXX and the Citibank fraud department woman was a very humiliating event that couldve easily escalated into police intervention and my murder. Yes, Mr. XXXX, grifting coupled with racism can be very profitable and very noxious.  CC : XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

Usbankreliacard denied my claim within 14 business days AFTER they FAILED to give me my 10 day provisional credit. I now had to open a new dispute on XX/XX/2020 as this is apart of identity theft, I have spoken with my attorney as well as the FTC and filed with them as well and will take the company to small claims court/arbitration if they do not honor my dispute and provide me with my funds by XX/XX/2020 ( 10 business days after filing another dispute on XX/XX/2020 ) my lawyer advised me since it is a larger amount about XXXX dollars to not allow them to deny my claim again and let them know we will go to court if needed. Due to the fact I have now sent in 27 documents of proof that I never even had a XXXX  XXXX  account, theres no transactions in my history on XXXX, XXXX hasnt been used in a year, and XXXX. Yet they refused to give me my credits back. According to regulation e, I am not responsible for any funds that are made on my account AFTER I reported fraud. I reported the first transaction in XXXX-XXXX. The representative documented it in my case but never shut my card off and sent me a new one. I know go see a XXXX  for the XXXX, XXXX this has caused, I also had to hire a lawyer, I spent hours a day on the phone with this bank. I sent proof from XXXX  and XXXX  that my social and personal information have been apart of a breach and identity theft. Therefore after speaking with my lawyer and the FTC I was made aware that I MUST be provided with my 10 day provisional credit. LEGALLY. That is my money. I sent in all documents and email exchanges proving that I have reached out to cashapp before contacting the bank to let them know to stop all transactions from my card, when they failed to do so I reached out again and alerted them I am reporting this to my bank. XXXX told me to reach out to the bank as they are fully aware of the identity theft. Someone tried to open another unemployment claim under my name, wrong social, and also tried to open a credit card a few months ago. Usbankreliacard is truly the worst I have sent everything over that is required plus additional information. I had to switch my pay to a debit card because of this breach. According to the FTC and my lawyer the company has until XX/XX/XXXX to provide me with Atleast my provisional credit. If they fail to do so I will follow up with both companies and file suit as it was there fault they didnt cancel my card and also their fault that this bank is supposed to reject any and all transactions from apps like XXXX- according to us bank supervisor XXXX I spoke to on XXXX but the bank failed to do that. They continued to allow transactions to go through and without even alerting me. I sent in proof I never used that app ever. I had to download it just so I could prove theres no transactions under my number and email address name and so fourth. I have placed a hold on all of my credit accounts and hAve sent in proof my accounts were compromised as well. When I reached out to XXXX  after checking my account I was in New Jersey and literally beyond distraught. I have XXXX children. I am now 2 months back on rent because of this! I never had to deal with identity theft in my life or something to this degree. Being my claim was opened now XXXX usbankreliacard has until XX/XX/XXXX to credit me back for the funds I have disputed.

0,0.6547067165374756,926,I get phone calls multiple times a week from Summit Recievables. They do n't know my name and they say they want to get information on a debt.

He gave me a bunch of random names suggesting one was my husband and that he spoke to someone at this number last week. I told him that was n't my husbands name and he had n't spoken to anyone at my number. I asked him to put me on the do not call list as I had no debts to pay. The next week I got another call a female left a message. They never give a name.
