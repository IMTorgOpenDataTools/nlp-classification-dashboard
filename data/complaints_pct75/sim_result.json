A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions.  ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title.  ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.  ( d ) Exception for resellers.  ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft.  ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information.  ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale.  ( e ) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs ( 1 ) through ( 3 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a ( p ) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft.  ( f ) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter.","threshold":0.030982906,"precision":0.4796479648,"recall":1.0,"f1score":0.6483271375,"support":"Pos: 436 \/ Neg: 500","tp":436,"tn":27,"fp":473,"fn":0},{"actualy":0,"yhat":0.0349674225,"id":880,"text":"FCRA states information reporting has to be 100 % verifiable and 100 % accurate otherwise the information must be removed under federal law.

At this point, the lending agency, Rushmore, was contacted to ensure closing protocols were in place. An inquiry was made concerning the upcoming XXXX mortgage payment. We asked if the final payment that would be made upon closing would suffice in lieu of XXXX 's mortgage payment. We also asked if this would create a negative report on our credit. We were assured by Rushmore that the final payment upon closing would be acceptable and that no negative report would be made showing a missed payment. As such, a final payoff amount was requested to complete closing paperwork. However, Rushmore failed to submit the final payoff as requested by both the loan holder and the closing attorney. This resulted in a delay in payment. Upon closing, the closing attorney secured an anticipated payoff amount from the purchasing lending agency and held all funds awaiting Rushmore 's response. Numerous requests were submitted by both us ( the loan holder ) and the closing attorney. We were informed by Rushmore that the payoff amount could not be emailed nor provided over the phone. It had to be faxed, which they failed to complete. After weeks of repeated attempts, the secured payment that was being held was finally made and we were assured that any overage would be reimbursed.

During the meeting, I specific asked Mr. XXXX if I was eligible for the {$700.00} Citi promotional bonus. Mr. XXXX stated that after funding the Citi Priority Checking account with {$50000.00} and the Citi XXXX account with {$200.00} that I would be eligible for the Citi Priority {$700.00} Promotional Bonus within Ninety [ 90 ] days after the funding date. At no time during XXXX did Mr. XXXX discuss with XXXX the following information provided by Citibank Client Care on XX\/XX\/XXXX XXXX The terms of the above promotion state a customer is not eligible for this offer if they are or were a signer on an existing consumer checking account within 180 calendar days [ 6 months ] of opening the new account. Your account records indicate you had exiting checking account number ending in XXXX which was opened on XX\/XX\/XXXX.  It should be mentioned that Mr. XXXX reviewed the Citibank Checking account that I opened on XX\/XX\/XXXX and closed on XX\/XX\/XXXX. Citibank Client Care clearly states that a customer is not eligible for the {$700.00} promotional offer if they are or were a signer on an existing consumer checking account within 180 calendar days [ 6 months ] of opening a new checking account. I opened a new checking account on XX\/XX\/XXXX, almost one year after opening the Citibank checking account ending in XXXX.  Several day later, I called and asked Mr. XXXX if he could email to me a statement confirming that I was eligible for the Citibank {$700.00} Promotional bonus. Mr. XXXX sent an email stating that I was eligible for the Citibank Promotional bonus.  Ninety days later, during the month of XX\/XX\/XXXX, I called Citibank to get a status on the {$700.00} Promotional bonus. I was informed by Citibank that the {$700.00} Promotional bonus would be available in my Citi Priority checking account within a few weeks.  In XX\/XX\/XXXX I called Citibank to get a status on the {$700.00} Promotional bonus. I was informed by Citibank that the {$700.00} Promotional bonus would be available in my Citi XXXX checking account within a few weeks.  On XX\/XX\/XXXX I called Citibank to get a status on the {$700.00} Promotional bonus. I was informed by Citibank that due to a prior Citi Priority checking account ending in XXXX, as of XX\/XX\/XXXX I didnt qualify for the {$700.00} Promotional bonus. Victimized by Citibanks alleged grifting proclivities, I immediately went to a local Citibank to close my Citi Priority Checking and Savings accounts.  While waiting for the Citibank Teller to close my Checking and Savings accounts, I received a call [ XXXX ] from a woman representing the Citibank fraud department. The woman rudely stated that she had attached a fraud alert and had frozen the funds on my Citibank Checking and Savings accounts while I was waiting at the Citibank Tellers window. The Citibank fraud department woman then asked me if I was aware of any fraudulent activity relating to my Citi Priority Checking account.  I mentioned to the Citibank fraud department woman that I wasnt aware of any fraudulent activity and that I was standing at the Citibank Tellers window waiting an unusually long period of time for the Citibank Teller to close the Checking and Savings accounts and to combined the balances from the two accounts into one check. I wasnt aware that in a sneaky manner the Citibank fraud department woman was accusing me of fraud and was freezing the accounts that I was attempting to close.  I believe that the Citibank fraud department woman was intentionally delaying the closing of my Citibank Checking and Savings accounts in preparation for police intervention against me, while I was patiently waiting at the Citibank Tellers window. A XXXX  woman calling the Police to investigate alleged fraud activity linked to an XXXX-American male visiting a Citibank is an instant death sentence for the XXXX-American male.      Summary In an attempt to clean up a very XXXX and asinine event, the Citibank fraud department woman angrily stated that she would remove the fraud alert and release the funds from my Checking and Savings accounts.  Based specifically on my race, Citibank intentionally conned me into participating in a fraudulent scheme while vomiting an XXXX  attempt to create an alleged grifting issue by intentionally freezing my Checking and Savings accounts and initiating an asinine fraud alert and possible police intervention as a method to seize the funds from my Citibank Checking and Savings accounts that I was patiently waiting to close on XX\/XX\/XXXX.  Upon activation of my Citibank Priority Checking and Savings accounts on XX\/XX\/XXXX, Citibank intentionally refused to inform me that I wasnt eligible for the Citibank Priority {$700.00} promotion. Instead, Citibank forced an employee [ Sesan Ogunsemowo ] to lie and to cheat in order to find a way to confiscate funds from my Citi Priority Checking and Savings accounts.  If I were a XXXX  man, the above-mentioned Citibank employees wouldnt dare attempt to lie, steal and cheat in order to take financial advantage of what they perceived to be a XXXX  and XXXX  XXXX targeted by alleged grifters. This asinine and alleged grifting scheme concocted by Mr. XXXX XXXX and the Citibank fraud department woman was a very humiliating event that couldve easily escalated into police intervention and my murder.

I wanted to contact you in reference to my credit rating with XXXX furniture?  apparently XXXX furniture has me charged off on the credit bureau reports and Im very upset by that because Im paying you guys money and have been paying you money for almost over a year somewhere close to a year of not over a year? Bill should be somewhat close to being almost paid off I mean seriously?  Im really disappointed at the fact that nobody has reported and told the truth not updated my information with all credit bureaus ... However ; being that all three credit bureaus contacted me and I saw no currently updates Ive decided to file a disputed issue about XXXX not updating that they are receiving current payments. This is unfair.  so XXXX XXXX will be getting notified about a dispute because nothing has been updated and I dont think I deserve this at all. You all need to go ahead on and update my credit reports I did re- establishment credit and did get things started back off with you guys again plus I renegotiated a payment I can afford to pay off my bill. With that being said, that stuff needs to be updated thus fairly documented. I can not believe this! I am so hurt over that I have worked so hard to try to bounce back with your company. The credit report rating is very unfair and very untrue Im hoping you can get in touch with the necessary party to fix that and have them update my information?  look at this attachment that I am sending you thank you so much have a good week.   XXXX email Response XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( 10 hours ago ) to me XXXX, Thank you for contacting us.  The account that we have in our office was charged off XX\/XX\/XXXX for non-payment. Yes you have made payment arrangements to settle the account, but once an account is charged off, it will only be reported in one of two ways, charged off or paid in full.  We still show a balance of {$900.00} with the last payment having been made on XX\/XX\/XXXX. So in short, your account is reporting correctly as there is an unpaid balance on a charged off account.  If you have indeed submitted a dispute, we will handle that through the appropriate channels.If you do have any additional questions, feel free to contact our office.  Sincerely, XXXX XXXX Recovery Specialist Eagle Financial Services Inc.

Due to the fact I have now sent in 27 documents of proof that I never even had a XXXX  XXXX  account, theres no transactions in my history on XXXX, XXXX hasnt been used in a year, and XXXX. Yet they refused to give me my credits back. According to regulation e, I am not responsible for any funds that are made on my account AFTER I reported fraud.

I know go see a XXXX  for the XXXX, XXXX this has caused, I also had to hire a lawyer, I spent hours a day on the phone with this bank. I sent proof from XXXX  and XXXX  that my social and personal information have been apart of a breach and identity theft. Therefore after speaking with my lawyer and the FTC I was made aware that I MUST be provided with my 10 day provisional credit. LEGALLY. That is my money. I sent in all documents and email exchanges proving that I have reached out to cashapp before contacting the bank to let them know to stop all transactions from my card, when they failed to do so I reached out again and alerted them I am reporting this to my bank. XXXX told me to reach out to the bank as they are fully aware of the identity theft. Someone tried to open another unemployment claim under my name, wrong social, and also tried to open a credit card a few months ago. Usbankreliacard is truly the worst I have sent everything over that is required plus additional information. I had to switch my pay to a debit card because of this breach.

They continued to allow transactions to go through and without even alerting me. I sent in proof I never used that app ever. I had to download it just so I could prove theres no transactions under my number and email address name and so fourth. I have placed a hold on all of my credit accounts and hAve sent in proof my accounts were compromised as well. When I reached out to XXXX  after checking my account I was in New Jersey and literally beyond distraught. I have XXXX children. I am now 2 months back on rent because of this! I never had to deal with identity theft in my life or something to this degree. Being my claim was opened now XXXX usbankreliacard has until XX\/XX\/XXXX to credit me back for the funds I have disputed.

Dear Sir or Maam, It is my third time writing a letter to your company. I recently conducted a review of my credit report, and I noticed Western Shamrock put several credit inquiries on credit report that I find to be problematic.  I know they are not mine, and they are fraudulent, but I dont have ( 30 ) thirty days to wait on an investigation, which I know I will win. I need to remove these inquiries very soon so I can get my V. A. loan for my house, please?  I have no recollection of doing any business with your company in my life. I got an auto financed with Global Lending, I watched the finance manager called this company, and I saw him send my application to this one company only.  I contacted your company and asked you all to take action and get these inquiries removed from all three credit bureaus. Your employees assured me they would comply with my request and take whatever steps necessary to resolve this issue. It is my last result.  I wanted to file this as well and make sure this gets done.  I am begging your company. Please investigate this and have these inquiries removed at your earliest possible convenience. I am applying for another home mortgage this week.  I would very much like to have the assurance my credit score is showing an accurate depiction of my creditworthiness.  Please update me with a full report on your findings soon, and I am begging. I look forward to having this situation rectified as soon as possible.

In XXXX XXXX, with less than a week before my account was to be debited for the XX\/XX\/XXXX payment, XXXX informed me that my program was being transferred to Money Management International ( MMI ). Apparently there was nothing I could do to prevent this transfer from occurring.Knowing that my bank would need specific information about MMI before it would honor the XX\/XX\/XXXX transaction and with less than a week before it was to occur, I began reaching out to MMI to secure the information my bank would need. I even contacted MMI by email and told them that unless someone specifically spoke with me by phone to get this information, I would authorize my bank not to honor the transaction should MMI try to withdraw the funds. MMI if they tried to contact me, did so as an \" unavailable '' or \" unknown '' caller - I do not answer such calls unless I recognize the number. \" MMI '' or the full company name never appeared on my caller ID.Over then next month, I repeatedly tried to speak with someone at MMI regarding my \" new '' account. In the meantime, I received an email from MMI with a mound of paperwork for me to complete for my \" new account ''. I contacted someone and spoke to a rep who was unable to locate my account ( because I had n't completed the paperwork for a \" new account '' ) ; I ca n't even remember how many times I had to tell the rep that my account was n't \" new '' but rather transferred against my wishes. I also mentioned several times that I needed to speak with someone regarding my account and why ( bank information ) - the line was disconnected. I tried calling back and was unable to get through. Waited a bit and tried a third, fourth, even fifth and more times but was unable to even get through.In XXXX XXXX, despite my repeated attempts to secure the necessary information from MMI for my bank, MMI tried to draft the XX\/XX\/XXXX payment.

XX\/XX\/XXXX, MMI finally reached out to me and spoke with me. It took two months before I had the information to forward to my bank.Two weeks later, I had an email from MMI indicating that one of my creditors had rejected payment and after speaking with the creditor, I found out that because it had taken MMI so long to actually speak to me ( for what amounted to about 10 minutes of basic information gathering ), the creditor had turned an account less than 60 days past due over to its collections dept. Not only that, but a payment that should have been made within five business days to my creditors had taken two weeks for MMI to deliver! MMI refused to find a way to ensure the XX\/XX\/XXXX payment was expedited to this creditor in particular and instead took another two weeks to attempt to send payment.When I contacted this particular creditor, I was given an new payment address. This second address again proved to be the wrong address, so while MMI sent the payment to the updated address, the XX\/XX\/XXXX and two XX\/XX\/XXXX payments were rejected once again. It took until XX\/XX\/XXXX before MMI contacted me and tried working with me.MMI refused to reach out to this creditor unless I was on the line ( my XXXX paperwork authorizes XXXX and now MMI to handle working with my creditors ; I do not need to be on the line for this ) and a conference call XX\/XX\/XXXX revealed that there was a third \" new '' payment address ( clearly a creditor issue ). MMI updated their payment records but it was a nightmare getting MMI to cooperate to send the rejected XX\/XX\/XXXX and XX\/XX\/XXXX payments to this new address.

Again, I explained to her that it was not me I was at work the day the Cash Advance happened ( a 50 minute drive from my office ) and was at home with my husband and friends the day the other charges occurred.

I have never had an experience like this with Capital One. I have {$0.00} fraud liability as I was told numerous times, yet now I'm being accused of making these fraudulent charges, called a liar, and told I have to prove my innocence. That day I filed a police report and called around to the locations where fraud was committed. XXXX was shocked to hear that I was told I have to handle the investigation and encouraged me to call back because that was absurd.   Over the next couple of days Capital One made an absolute mess of my card charging me and then crediting me back over and over again and charging me twice for the {$72.00} processing fee. I called Capital One back on XX\/XX\/XXXX and spoke to a new representative. I asked her about all the charging and crediting back to my card and went through my story again.

I never called in a replacement card and was never notified ( by email or phone ) that a new card was headed my way. Sure enough I pulled up video camera footage and have proof that someone stole the mail from my house which contained the Capital One replacement card. The representative I spoke to on XX\/XX\/XXXX made note of this and said she would remark the charges as fraud.   I am exhausted and tired of doing Capital One 's job for them. It has been 11 days of back and forth with no real answers as to what Capital One will do got remedy this situation.

I have a loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX that began In XXXX of XXXX when I purchased a XXXX XXXX  from a used car dealer. Two months later, in XXXX of XXXX, I signed up for XXXX XXXX XXXX 's auto-pay service, to assure prompt payments. Even though I had auto-pay, each month I received unnecessary mail from XXXX XXXX about the bill, advertising material, and offers. A year later, in XX\/XX\/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX asking to GO PAPERLESS. They said they don't have Paperless. I replied that I don't need paper bills or offers from the company since I'm on auto-pay. The representative responded that they could stop communication, but I never had any understanding that I would never be notified under any circumstances.   Late last summer ( XXXX ), I misplaced my ATM card at home. I phoned the bank asking to put a hold on it until I found it. XXXX insisted that the card be canceled. Though I found the card the next morning, the card was canceled. It was an otherwise minor event but could haunt me for the next 7 years. THIS IS GROSSLY UNFAIR.   In XXXX of XXXX, when my ATM number didn't allow the payment to be pulled from my bank account, XXXX XXXX did nothing, and in XXXX they reported me as 30 days delinquent. This caused my CREDIT SCORE TO PLUMMET BY 70 POINTS. I found out from a credit reporting service I subscribe to and I quickly called XXXX XXXX and promptly paid them, as I have each month of the loan. Because the auto-pay was set up over a year back, I thought it pulled directly from my bank account, not through my ATM card.    When I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, asking that they reverse the 30 days late on my credit reports, because they never notified me that the auto-payment did not pull from my bank account, they replied that on XX\/XX\/XXXX, I had requested a \" Cease and Desist '' order, which I had never heard of. They can see that I'd never missed a payment, which is proof of the fact that it happened in error. After some online research, I learned that this \" cease & desist, '' is usually used when a customer has a dispute with a company and the customer feels legally abused. In this case, why would someone with no problems with a company ask for a Cease & Desist order? I only wanted to go PAPERLESS and it has caused tremendous difficulty.   Over the past 7 months, I have constantly reached out to Credit Acceptance, and to the 3 bureaus, only to be rebuffed by XXXX and given the \" party line '' that I asked for no contact ( which I DID NOT ). This is a HUGE misunderstanding and the company 's policy should immediately be changed. Paperless and Never Contact me, are two grossly different requests. They must be decoupled in the XXXX XXXX rules & regs. This is a disservice to the company 's customers. Asking to be paperless is recommended in most company 's rules. A rule stating if you want to be paperless, the only option you have is to never be contacted under any circumstances is frankly asinine. What conscious corporation doesn't have a paperless option?   Collaterally, I just re-signed up for automatic payment today, and their automated telephone payment services instructions state that you are signing up for notices and disclosures, which goes against their avowed \" Cease & Desist '' rule, which I never asked for.

More recently I was again approved for a modification, however, it was based on a fictitious annual earning which was \" literally '' double our household earnings. After pointing out the earnings error several times they then reduced our annual approval value to {$8600.00} per monthlystill far more than our monthly earnings of {$5600.00} which we had clearly stated n multiple occasions. Because we would not be able to pay the monthly mortgage which was based on a modification using erroneous monthly earnings we opted not move forward with the mortgage modification which only reduced our mortgage payment by {$86.00} per month and extended our mortgage another 21 years ( we have documentation verifying all of this ).  After realizing they would not provide us with a real modification we opted to pursue a Short Sale.  They are now recycling us in a never ending cycle of submitting the same paperwork. I have provided Shellpoint Mortgage Services the requested paperwork no less than 10 times. Each and every time the process comes to the same result whereby Shellpoint Mortgage Services ultimately tells me they need the same documents filled out over and over again and threatens to take me to court. I have an extensive email trail I can provide as a proof source for this. Additionally, I have verified with the Loss Mitigation division of Shellpoint mortgage services that the conversations we are having, and their request for information, are being recorded. In these conversations I have verified with them if the email they are currently requesting is provided that will meet all of their needs for documentation. This is the 10th time I have provided them with what they have requested yet they are telling me they need different documentation. The realtor and mortgage company that I have used no longer wants to work with this company.  I am writing to request your support yet again to get this issue resolved so I can move on with my life in a positive and productive manner. This is having on toll emotional hardship on myself, my children and my marriage which ended up resulting in a divorce on XX\/XX\/XXXX mainly to do with all of the problems associated with our living environment.   This is a copy of the last email I provided Shellpoint Dear Shellpoint Mortgage, I can say in all honesty the Short Sales and Modification process through Shellpoint Mortgage Services is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in my life. For years now I have been attempting to either get a mortgage modification or a short sale on my current residence. Each and every time you send me a packet of information to fill out. Each and every time I fill out that information. And each and every time I am forced to go through a painful process up continuously providing you with that same information over and over again, piecemeal.  I am initially sent a packet stating you have received my modification packet or short sale request packet and it is being reviewed. Then sometime later I receive an additional mailing stating the packet is in complete and you want this form or that document, which by the way was already provided. I then follow up with those documents and you tell me now you need additional documentation. You might either be requesting additional documents which you have already been sent or you could be stating that documents which you have received are now out of date etc.   As you can see from the email below dated Friday, XX\/XX\/XXXX XXXX XXXX  I had a conversation with you XXXX, after having a conversation on XX\/XX\/XXXX with XXXX and during that conversation I was told you needed three documents which are outlined in that conversation.

This agent told me there was a possibility the money would post since it was full three payments and got me under my 30 day late threshold. She also told me to check back.

Then I get notification from my bank that several hard inquiries had been run on my credit. I contacted the 3 lending institutions that I saw and inquired if any were Nissan financing none were. I contacted the manager of the dealership to give him a chance to correct this wrong. He said he was not there that day and he would check for me. He called back and said that XXXX had not informed the assistant manager that was there that day that I had my own financing nor did he tell him that I was shopping for a used vehicle. That XXXX had informed him that I desperately needed a vehicle. I did not give any one permission to try to get me financing nor did anyone ever ascertain from me the terms I would want to obtain a loan or even how much down payment I had as this information was already in my loan application with my bank XXXX and I had been approved for a loan through them for up to {$14000.00}. on a used vehicle of my choice. The manager said he would not contest when I sent my letters to the credit bureau that they ran unauthorized loan applications without permission using my information. But I find this practice very unethical and they lied to me and I am sure running someone's credit information without permission is wrong and should be prosecuted. I have further received a letter from XXXX that says they declined to give me a loan. I called them and told them I did not apply for a loan with them. They were not interested in finding out that XXXX XXXX  XXXX Georgia ran this without my permission. It would seem that every bank that XXXX XXXX  XXXX Georgia pulled into this scheme of illegal behavior would also be culpable. I am not sure of the number of times they applied for credit for me without my permission or knowing how much I had to put down or any terms that I would want to complete a loan. The manager said XXXX never checked Nissan financing and that would only take a phone call and he did not need my information to ascertain the interest rates from Nissan. This seems to have been deceptive from the beginning nor has anyone informed me the interest rate or any other relevant information that I would need to make a determination. This was deceit from the beginning and these actions have been detrimental to me. These actions have harmed me as now the interest rate of my approved loan will be adversely affected by the deceitful actions of XXXX XXXX XXXX Georgia. I will be happy to provide any and all information that you will need along with the contact information for my witness.","threshold":0.5726495726,"precision":0.8509485095,"recall":0.7201834862,"f1score":0.7801242236,"support":"Pos: 436 \/ Neg: 500","tp":314,"tn":445,"fp":55,"fn":122},{"actualy":0,"yhat":0.5285708308,"id":695,"text":"I RECEIVED A TEXT MESSAGE FROM DIRECT EXPRESS AT PHONE # XXXX STATING THAT MY PIN NUMBER HAD BEEN CHANGED.

At that time, BOTH of my parents were retired, living on a combined Social Security of about {$1100.00} - {$1200.00} per month.

I could eliminate the {$50.00} fee by using my debit card XXXX a year but they locked my account without my knowledge. About XXXX years ago i called Regions and tried for a loan modification or to get this interest only loan to be changed to a permanent loan. I sent in my paperwork, proof of income, all docs. A few weeks later they told me that it is actually better to stay on current loan payment because changing over to a fixed interest rate would raise my payments by almost double.

At that time, I checked XXXX XXXX Bank - which showed a deposit of {$1100.00} ( see attached. ) I did not apply for, go online thinking about applying for, or call or write anyone in any attempt to get any payday or other loan. So I went directly to my bank, asked them how this company has access to deposit money in my account? The bank would only tell me that the transaction was authorized. So I closed that account with them and re-opened a new account.   The lender is CashNet USA or similar name. The loan looks like it was deposited on XXXX\/XXXX\/XXXX - to XXXX in XXXX ( XXXX branch ) .I am a XXXX resident, and was born and raised here. After speaking with XXXX office last week, I was advised that currently this company does not have a license to 'lend money ' to anyone residing here. ( CashNet USA 's website also confirms this.   I should say that from about XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX, I did in fact have a loan through CashNet, but paid it off in full and have documents from CashNet to prove it.   So, someone went online and applied for a loan in my name. This current loan lists the account # XXXX which is the same account # on my payoff documents.

And now I 'm FORCED to take action, and lose time from work etc.   I believe CashNet, through some layers of deception, deposited this money on purpose in hopes I 'd just and pay them.

I got someone named XXXX on the phone who said my remaining balance was over {$500.00}. I was livid. I told her the entire history of the account, what I was told was due and everything. From this point on the runaround was horrible. Whenever I called I was always placed on hold for over an hour and when I did speak to someone they refused to acknowledge the payment they had already received. They gave me a different balance each time. Finally I told them never to call me again and that I would be sending the XXXX money order that I was originally quoted and Ace Cash Expres would not receive any additional money from me. I did n't understand why I had to split my payments that way anyway when on my first phone call I was prepared to pay it off in full.   So on XXXX\/XXXX\/XXXX I did exactly as requested and purchased a money order for XXXX. I did n't mail it off until XX\/XX\/XXXX because I kept trying to reach someone in a position of authority to acknowledge the payment amount before I would send it.   For months I did n't hear from them anymore but yesterday I received a letter from a collection agency by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX asking for a payment of XXXX on behalf of Ace Cash Express.
