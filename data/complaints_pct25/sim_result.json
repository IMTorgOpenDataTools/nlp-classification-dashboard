I have been attempting to get some help since XXXX of XXXX after doing some research online to see if anyone else has been experiencing unfair practices via XXXX.   My experience is with the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency ( PHEAA ) directly.   As you can see from the following class action lawsuit filed in XX\/XX\/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which does business as XXXX XXXX and American Education Services ( AES ), attempted to delay debtors ' loan forgiveness in order to continue collecting interest and fees. I have had my loans serviced by both AES and now XXXX in the last decade ( since completing XXXX XXXX in XXXX ).   The suit poses that helping these borrowers get out of debt sooner directly conflicts with PHEAAs financial interest in collecting interest and servicing fees on active loans. The lawsuit argues ( and what my exact experience has been ) is that PHEAA has orchestrated a scheme to extend the length of debtors loans, and therefore earn more revenue, by improperly delaying or failing to process  their applications to forgiveness programs and incorrectly placing their loans into forbearance or deferment status.   Debtors are told NOT TO PAY while their account is being processed ( which happens annually as XXXX mandates that borrowers complete annual recertification for their Income Driven Repayment plans ). This includes lengthy processing times and insufficient information from their servicers to meet recertification deadlines ; overpayments being misapplied such that, instead of reducing the principal balance of the loan, the payment was applied to future balances and placed the loan in paid ahead status.   Why does my current statement need to say : Your account is current {$0.00} due You will be alerted when your next payment is ready? This is sooo tricky! They hope I wont pay so that I NEVER GET TO 120 QUALIFIED PAYMENTS.   My current balance and outstanding interest continues to grow, they arent telling me what my minimum payment should be, and all I can do is pay what my last amount was.   A note on paying ahead from their website : Paying on an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan You can not pay ahead past your IDR anniversary or recertification date. Any extra funds remaining at the time of your IDR anniversary or recertification deadline will be immediately applied to your loans ( not to a future bill ), and your paid ahead status will end. However, you still have the option of paying extra, and you can enter paid ahead status again, through your next IDR anniversary or recertification.   So, basically I have to just wait for them to process my recertification before I can make payments that count towards my 120 qualified payments. And ofcourse I just noticed this webpage about paying ahead when writing this email to you ( it must be a new one they recently added ), and it says : Considering Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) Paying ahead while seeking PSLF can adversely affect your qualifying payment count. If you pay extra and enter a paid ahead status while seeking PSLF, any future bills that you satisfy may not  immediately count as qualifying payments. If you want to pay more than your required monthly payment, please contact us and request to have paid ahead status permanently removed.   Ive had a terrible ordeal with AES and then XXXX since XX\/XX\/XXXX, have sent them emails and called them to try to get my miscalculated payments resolved since XX\/XX\/XXXX, and have still not heard back.   I finally got someone on the phone to tell me in a whisper, just keep making the same payment amount every month, even if it says you are all paid up and it doesnt tell you what your payment is, that way you stay on track towards your 120 payments. ( Now I see that I have to request to have the paid ahead status permanently removed. ) I had no idea if he was even being honest or correct, but it seemed like the better alternative to not paying, and being put on automatic Forbearance while I took additional XXXX classes for professional development, or while my account was being recertified. It seems like for the last 10 years, every time Ive called, I would get a different answer from whoever I talked to and whenever anything has changed, they have not notified their debtors.   Below are the emails I sent to XXXX in XX\/XX\/XXXX. I think what is most important to note and what seems the craziest to me is that from what I could see every few years, my account was put in forebarence and my loan increased by thousands of dollars. In XX\/XX\/XXXX interest capitalized by {$3800.00}. In XX\/XX\/XXXX interest again capitalized by {$8000.00} because I was under the impression that I was on Auto Payment., but was actually just removed from it by XXXX ( unknowingly ) and when they werent receiving payments from me, they capitalized my interest.   XX\/XX\/XXXX Hello, I have been having lots of issues with my student loans and was hoping to speak with a Public Service Loan Forgiveness Specialist as soon as possible to help clarify these issues. My number is XXXX. The issues that I would like to talk about are below : In general my employment certification says that Ive made 81 qualifying payments since my Loan Disbursement Date of XX\/XX\/XXXX ( calculated until XX\/XX\/XXXX ), though I am calculating a total of 88 qualifying payments. That is a miscalculation of 7 qualifying payments.  During my first employment certification ( XX\/XX\/XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX ) there is a total of 1 issue that needs to be remedied.  ( 1 ) 39 payments were calculated. I payed a total of 40 payments during that time. Therefore, there is a discrepancy of 1 total payment. I paid every month from XX\/XX\/XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX and also paid on XX\/XX\/XXXX, for a total of 40 payments. The only payment I did not make was XX\/XX\/XXXX payment because I was told not to pay anything while my IBR was being recalculated ( no bill was due ). I have no record of whether or not my interest itemized at this time as my loan was transferred after this time and I have no access to the records from the former financial institution.  Date Payment Made Amount of Payment Made XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX was told no payment due during IBR recertification XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$16.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$16.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$16.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$16.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$17.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$140.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$140.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$140.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$140.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$330.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$250.00} During my second employment certification ( XX\/XX\/XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX ) there is a total of 1 issue that needs to be clarified for me.  ( 1 ) 23 payments were calculated and this is correct, as I paid a total of 23 payments during that time. Though I just noticed when looking back at all of it after asking for all the paperwork, that when I was put on forbearance, while my IBR was being recalculated ( for instance in XX\/XX\/XXXX while I was told to not pay anything toward my loan, and my was not sent a bill ) my interest capitalized by {$3800.00}!!! Why would this have happened, and why would no one have told me that this would happen? Had I known that this would happen, I would have continued to pay Ive always been incredibly responsible and loyal to my payments, and totally feel like Ive been completely sideswiped.  Date Payment Made Amount of Payment Made XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX INTEREST CAPITALIZED {$3800.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$63.00} During my third employment certification ( XX\/XX\/XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX ) there were no issues.  14 payments were calculated and this is correct, as I paid a total of 14 payments during that time.  During my fourth employment certification ( XX\/XX\/XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX ) there were 4 total issue that need to be remedied and\/or clarified.  ( 1 ) 5 payments were calculated by XXXX  XXXX and this is incorrect, as I paid a total of 11 payments during that time. Therefore, there is a discrepancy of 6 total payments.  ( 2 ) I was on Auto Payment from XX\/XX\/XXXX - XX\/XX\/XXXX, and while I was on Auto Pay, there was an extra payment taken out in XX\/XX\/XXXX. That payment should have also counted toward my qualifying payments ( and should be part of the total 11 payments ).  ( 3 ) This is just a note about how unfair I think this whole thing is : The ONLY reason I was not paying my loans from XX\/XX\/XXXX XX\/XX\/XXXX was because I was under the impression that I was on Auto Payment. I had just recently had twins ( in XXXX ) and was under lots of stress and was concerned that I would miss my payments, so I did the RESPONSIBLE thing and put myself on Auto Pay. After a few months, I realized that payments were not coming out of my bank account ( Auto Pay just STOPPED ), because I needed to complete paperwork to calculate my IBR. I wasnt paying attention to the XXXX XXXX emails because I was so overloaded that I couldnt get through everything in my inbox ( and when I saw emails from XXXX XXXX  I assumed they were emails confirming Auto Pay as before, so I didnt pay much attention ). Again, this hit me like a TON OF BRICKS. As soon as I realized what was happening, I rectified the situation, but it was too late again I was hit with over {$8000.00} in interest capitalization!  ( 4 ) How is anyone supposed to get out of student debt in this process? Ive been paying for a decade and my loan amount has INCREASED by {$12000.00} and thats only in the last 5 years! As I mentioned before, I cant get records from the former institution that held my loans right now, so I have no idea what happened before they got moved to XXXX XXXX.  ( 5 ) Date Payment Made Amount of Payment Made XX\/XX\/XXXX {$290.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX INTEREST CAPITALIZED {$8000.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} XX\/XX\/XXXX {$120.00} I would really appreciate speaking with someone who could ( 1 ) help me get my qualified payments up to 88 ( 7 additional ) ( 2 ) help me lower my monthly payments as part of the reason the payments are so high is because I keep getting hit with the interest capitalization because I keep being told not to pay. This past time when I called XXXX XXXX ( yesterday ), after being put on forbearance because I am taking classes again, and I asked to be taken off forbearance, I asked if I could keep paying even though my bill said {$0.00} was due, and this was the FIRST time someone told me that I could do that and have my payments qualify. In the past, when Ive asked, no one seemed sure, so I didnt make payments, because I wasnt sure they would qualify, and I didnt know how much to make.   On XX\/XX\/XXXX resent email Hello. I sent the following email on XX\/XX\/XXXX and then followed up by phone asking for a listing of all of my payments to date. I've received nothing. Can someone please help me?  XX\/XX\/XXXX Hello, I have been having lots of issues with my student loans and was hoping to speak with a Public Service Loan Forgiveness Specialist as soon as possible to help clarify these issues.

The offer terms communicated to me were as follows : 0 % intro APR until XX\/XX\/XXXX, earn {$150.00} one-time cash bonus when you spend {$500.00} on purchases w\/in 3 months of account opening, plus no annual fee.  The following week I received a confirmation letter indicating that I was approved for a credit card issued by Capital One. On XX\/XX\/XXXX, I received my credit card and proceeded with a call to activate it. XXXX, at Capitol One, completed the process and confirmed my card had been activated. She indicated that she had used an alternative method as I did not have the capability to send a photo of my drivers license using a smartphone. She had me call her from my phone, as this was an alternative method for her to perform the activation process. Per her disclosure, our conversation was recorded.  On XX\/XX\/XXXX while making a purchase with my new card, the card was declined. I immediately called Capital One and spoke with XXXX. I explained to him that my card had been activated by XXXX and that I had not received any notification from Capital One stating otherwise. He ignored my statement and implied that my card was not activated and was restricted as he needed to perform some convoluted process which involved my emailing a drivers license from my cell phone I informed him that I did not have that capability. XXXX was rude, abrupt, and rather than provide a satisfactory solution or acknowledgement that my card was previously activated, he eagerly offered to close my account.  On XX\/XX\/XXXX, I phoned Capitol One and spoke with XXXX. She indicated that after my card was activated, it was restricted by the fraud department and that a front and back photo of my drivers license was required. She agreed that I should have been notified about the restriction and provided me with a link so I could send it and I complied with her request. She stated that I would receive a phone call once my card was activated.  When notification was not received, I phoned Capital One on XX\/XX\/XXXX. I spoke with Representative, XXXX, at a call center in XXXX XXXX who informed me that he could not read the back side of my drivers license. I explained to him that I had complied and fulfilled all of Capital Ones activation expectations twice and it was time for Capital One to remove their restriction from my card and to discontinue bullying and denying me activation for my credit card. He connected me to XXXX who directed me to resend a copy of my drivers license using the same link previously provided to me. I resent it again as she remained on the line. Again she indicated that the backside of my drivers license was not too clear so once again, I resent it. She then directed me to use a smartphone to take the photo and resend it, after I had notified her and the previous representatives that I did not have that capability or own a smartphone.  On XX\/XX\/XXXX ( XXXX PST ) I received a phone call from XXXX, on behalf of Capitol One. He requested that I again submit a photo of my Drivers License from a smartphone, after I had repeatedly informed Capitol One that I did not own a smartphone, so I could not comply with his particular request. XXXX said that my card would remain restricted and I would not be able to use it.  Its incomprehensible to me that activating a credit card is such an obscured process for Capital One to accomplish? Furthermore, Capital One never once communicated or disclose to me that owning a smartphone was required for opening up or activating a credit card account. Capital Ones reaction\/responses to me, regarding this matter, have infringed upon and exploited my consumers rights, especially since I have made every effort to satisfy and comply with Capital Ones requirements.  By enticing and involving consumers to become new customers, then creating obstacles and making unjustifiable demands, is evidence that Capital Ones pretext in denying activation for my credit card, is a convoluted scam and rip-off. This stunt is designed to obstruct customers from deriving specified benefits. Capital One needs to activate my card at once and remove unwarranted restrictions.","threshold":0.5166666667,"precision":0.9210526316,"recall":0.5109489051,"f1score":0.6572769953,"support":"Pos: 137 \/ Neg: 163","tp":70,"tn":157,"fp":6,"fn":67},{"actualy":1,"yhat":0.4183713794,"id":735,"text":"This company tried to charge me a usury interest rate of over 800 % which is illegal in the USA ...

When the loan was originally taken out I was in need of a small amount to cover my rent charges. I had every intention of paying off the loan in full with my next paycheck, but other circumstances came about and I was unable. I figured that I would be charged the fee amount and would see a significant reduction in my remaining loan balance. Since originally receiving the loan I have made payments of the following amounts on the following dates : XXXX\/XXXX\/2016 = ( {$100.00} ), XXXX\/XXXX\/2016 = ( {$97.00} ), XXXX\/XXXX\/2016 = ( {$94.00} ), XXXX\/XXXX\/2016 = ( {$91.00} ), XXXX\/XXXX\/2016 = ( {$85.00} ), XXXX\/XXXX\/2016 = ( {$82.00} ) & XXXX\/XXXX\/2016 = ( {$79.00} ) these amounts totalled {$710.00} debited from my account on a loan that was originally {$300.00}. Mind you that my principal balance has only dropped to {$280.00} due. The reason I havent paid of the loan sooner is because of the high fees and other circumstances I have been forced to take out other payday loans to stay affloat which has landed me in a huge financial crisis. I am a resident of Minnesota and Minnesota 's laws state that a loan between {$250.00} & {$350.00} payday lenders can not charge more than 6 % annual interest ( minimum {$17.00} ) plus a {$5.00} fee. Green Trust Cash 's loan was an annual percentage of 667.41 % with total payments coming out to {$1600.00} on a {$300.00} loan. THAT IS RIDICULOUS! I contacted the company Green Trust Cash about their extremely high fees and not reducing my principal balance as well as asked them for a refund of {$210.00} ( the amount in fees already paid compared to Minnesota 's Payday Lending Laws ) because I paid this company {$710.00} on a {$300.00} loan. They promptly responded stating that they are a Tribal Lender based out of Montana and that they do not need to adhere to local State laws. They stated the following : \" Clearly stated on our website and in the contract you executed it states Green Trust Cash, LLC ( the \" Company '' ) is a wholly owned and operated entity of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the \" Tribe '' ) on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Montana ( the \" Reservation '' ).

I work in the financial services industry and understand how Fraud Alerts work. I have very good credit ( XXXX score ), and should easily be able to obtain an approval for a store credit card. As a result of my good credit and in an effort to keep it that way, I have placed an initial alert on my credit report to contact me at my primary cell phone number ( home number secondarily ).  The first time I applied ( around XXXX 2015 ), I was standing in the store and submitted and application at the point of sale. As I stood there for several minutes with my cell phone in hand waiting for a call to clear the alert, I eventually had the clerk call the credit department who informed me that I was declined because I did n't answer the phone when they called. My cell phone was in my hand the entire time and had maximum signal ( and I confirmed, they did not call my home number by mistake ). I asked them to retry and they said they ca n't - \" you get one try only ''. After arguing with them and asking to speak to a supervisor, I eventually gave up due to the line forming behind me in-store. I was told that I had to wait 30 days ( I believe ) to reapply - at the time, my frustration about the situation made me think that there is no way I would ever reapply for a Macy 's card.  A couple months later I decided to try again, because without a Macy 's card you are forced to pay higher prices for purchases - which is a primary concern of mine here. My second attempt in XXXX 2015 was around XXXX Pacific time from my home computer. I reapplied online and had my cellphone sitting by my side the entire time, waiting for it to ring. It did n't. I soon received an email saying my application was suspended until further information could be obtained - it included a customer service number where I learned that they were only open until XXXX EASTERN time ; and therefore, I had to wait until the next day. Sometime around XXXX the next day, Macy 's credit call while I was in the shower ; no message was left, but I reverse dialed the number and confirmed it was in fact Macy 's Credit Department. I then called the customer service line and was told the same thing again - one try to clear the alert and then you 're declined. I again argued with the CSR and eventually asked to speak to a manager. XXXX ( supervisor ) came on the line and explained to me that their system prevents them from clearing an alert after the one-attempt had failed and that I could reapply in \" X '' days ( I do n't remember, I think he said 30 day ). I asked to speak to a SVP or higher, which was declined. I hung up in utter frustration.  My concern here is that I 'm being forced to pay more for items at Macy 's because of their inflexible and unfair credit issuing practices ( generally Macy 's card holders save XXXX % on purchases ). I have great credit, a lot of disposable income and am a very responsible credit user. Macy 's practices are flawed and they need to be investigated and corrected as a result. Can you please let me know what you can do for me ( and countless others ) in this situation? I question the entire industry practice of discounting for Store Card holders if they 're not going to apply fair lending practices.  Thank you XXXX XXXX, I look forward to the CFPB 's response.

I was furious with them as I did not have time to finish providing all this information over the phone, which had already been submitted online. I had to end the call and told them I would call back during the afternoon as I was running late for a meeting and had not expected the so called \" Your Done Process '' to take so long. Later in the afternoon I called them back to finish up the pre-approved loan. I then learned I was required to download a mobile app on my Iphone called \" XXXX ''. This allowed them to access and view all the history of my checking account. They said nothing about additional underwriting or the way my funds were spent from my checking account. I only gave them permission to view my direct deposits and not my spending activity. The employee verbally confirmed she saw where my direct deposits had been posted to my checking account. This second phone call took an additional 15 minutes or more?? At the end of the call the employee stated I 'll submit this to our verification department and see if you are approved. Approved???? How many times did I make it clear that I understood this loan to be pre-approved!!! I am tired of pay day lenders lying to people and getting away with it. The false statements about being pre-approved must stop. Pay day lenders claim their pre-approved status is for application purposes only. If so, they should make it clear. I am very thankful for the CFBP. I know you want to help the consumer. Please consider this an area for all pay day lenders to comply. Here is how the story ends. I used their live chat to inquire about needing to send any additional information. Live chat said if you inquiring about loan approval, it has been denied. Lets just say I was not happy after wasting time over this so called pre-appoved loan. I was not nice to the online chat people!! The reason the loan was denied was because my checking account showed XXXX other loans, according to them. What they did not realize is that XXXX were paid off. The remaining XXXX loans have a combined balance of less than {$600.00}. If you are going to do true underwriting, a lender should make it clear that pre-approval means nothing!! I also believe payday lenders should not have access to a persons checking account. I can see why you need to verify income and employment, just ask for proof of pay stubs. No pay day lender should ever be allowed to access your checking account and view your personal activity. By the end of the day, I received a loan but from another lender without all of the verification and checking account snooping. The process for my new loan took less than five minutes. It worked out to be in my favor as the interest rate for this loan is 50 % less than what MyQuickWallet.com was going to charge.","threshold":0.69,"precision":1.0,"recall":0.1240875912,"f1score":0.2207792208,"support":"Pos: 137 \/ Neg: 163","tp":17,"tn":163,"fp":0,"fn":120},{"actualy":1,"yhat":0.4973109365,"id":294,"text":"fees and payments were different than what they are deducting from my bank account ; additionally i have learned they are n't licensed or authorized to do business in VA ; also no instructions for stopping ACH transactions on statement ; terms and conditions or website.","threshold":0.6933333333,"precision":1.0,"recall":0.102189781,"f1score":0.1854304636,"support":"Pos: 137 \/ Neg: 163","tp":14,"tn":163,"fp":0,"fn":123},{"actualy":0,"yhat":0.4987049103,"id":1780,"text":"On XX\/XX\/XXXX, I called the AmeriSave Mortgage Corporation to check their 30 year conventional rates. A loan officer responded and ran some numbers verbally. He strongly recommended, because I have a lot of credit card debt, I should refinance with a cash-out. He said first do the cash-out with them to pay off credit cards and my solar panel loan and then do another 30 year refinance 6 months later with very low interest rate with them. The cash out amount was very high and enough to pay off my solar panel and also 90 % of my credit cards. I was interested but I wanted to see the numbers on the paper. He took me to their online application site and told me to e-sign some documents but I couldn't because of the wrong information on the document - my ssn was different. He said he fixed it but we couldn't go any further with e-signing any documents. I was looking for the good faith estimate that shows a rough estimate but he didn't show me. Until then I thought that I will probably see it in the next screen but he took me to the credit card intake page and asked to enter my credit card information for {$500.00}. I asked him why it says {$500.00} and not refundable. He said \" it's refundable and our conversation was being recorded. '' I asked if AmeriSave is a legit company. He said his company is rated A+ at XXXX. But that was my mistake I trusted him and provided my credit card. He then finished application process and scheduled an appraisal. I got an email from him with a link to the application. I checked the link but still no GFE and the early disclosure documents I needed to sign were not visible. Because of the high cash out amount, I wanted to check numbers first, but nothing about the cash out amount or costs were showing nowhere in the application. So I worried about being scammed and decided to cancel it. The application does not have a cancel option so I sent him an email right away on XXXX that I wish to cancel the application like within an hour or two. I received no response. I called their customer service but no response. I chatted through their online chat service but it was not working. I didn't know they already charged my credit card at that time but I found out they did so I contacted their customer service again but at a different phone number found online but told me to contact the loan officer. I sent another email to him and CC 'd to the AmeriSave customer support. He responded back to me via email and he called me and he was very upset that I canceled and he can not refund the money. He will talk to his manager and get back to me on XX\/XX\/XXXX Thursday. He called me back on XX\/XX\/XXXX Friday and told me that his manager can not refund my money. My English is not good so they were able to trick me into providing my credit card information online. I couldn't esign any initial documents because of their system glitches and incorrect information displayed on their documents. Their cash out amount was so high and attractive and promised that he would do non cash-out after 6 months with a very low rate. As the actual cash out amount depends on the appraisal results i wanted to see the GFE first but they never provided. They also told me that if I close the cash out loan with them, they can lock with a very low rate when I do my 30 year refi loan with them again after 6 months. And that will save a lot of money. I really wanted to see all the details of what he was saying on a document but they never provided and felt that it was not safe to do business with them so I canceled it right away. They didn't start the loan process so I am little confused how they can charge my credit card. I feel like I am scammed.

They charged my card, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX SD XXXX on that day and then two weeks later, we agreed I would pay the remaining amount of XXXX, with a XXXX transaction fee each time. The company that I had received the loan from was called XXXX XXXX. On doing a little research, I found out that this is no longer a company. I called the representative back and told her this and she stated that the companymay have changed names or gone out of business but that does n't mean I do n't owe the debt, and she would proceed with court if I did n't honor the payment arrangement. So that I what I did. I finished the final payment and received an email saying the debt was cleared afterward. A few days later I received a very similar call from the same company, Phoenix Equity Partners. I returned the call and was short with them, as I had just severly shorted myself financially by paying off the supposed pay day loan and I was angry they were still calling. She then told me that they had received TWO more pay day loans that they were to collect from me. One for the amount of XXXX and one for the amount of XXXX, one taken in XXXX and one taken in XXXX. I was frustrated and started to think that the company was actually a scam to get money from me. I ignored calls from a XXXX XXXX for two days following. These supposed loans, which I do n't recall taking out, were from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I told XXXX XXXX I would not be making any payments or arrangements until I was sent verification of the debt, and some paperwork on my case. She said that it was impossible, that they had NO paperwork, and that if I did not make a payment plan that day that they would pursue legal action, and I would be charged many fees for them having to do so. I simply can not afford it, and so, I made a payment arrangement. I am trying to rebuild my credit and I am very afraid of having to go to court for financial reasons.
